A moving_filesystem_data_store that moves files found in datastore to a given location has been implemented. The data store is is implemented in the same way as the archiving_filesystem_data_store is but does not zip the data. Instead is creates a folder named after the records label (in the same way the archivinfs does) and store the data inside there.

A moving_filesystem_data_store can be setup via "smt init (/configure) --move (/-MO) /target/path/

An additional feature to add files to a record was implemented. This was done to enable the user to keep track of post processing data belonging to a simulation using Sumatra.
To enable the adding of files to a record a new category for records has been implemented called "evaluation_data" and two functions called add_evaluation_data and remove_evaluation_data have been added in projects.py.

Syntax:

project.add_evaluation_data(recordlabel, filename)
project.remove_evaluation_data(recordlabel, sumatra.datastore.base.DataKey, delete=True/False)
(where project comes from project=load_project())

add_evaluation_data adds a file to a record (identified by its label) and moves the file to the record's data store if outside of it.
remove_evaluation_data removes a file from a record and deletes it if delete=True (False by default).
