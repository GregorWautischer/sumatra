A moving_filesystem_data_store that moves files found in datastore to a given location has been implemented. The data store is is implemented in the same way as the archiving_filesystem_data_store is but does not zip the data. Instead is creates a folder named after the records label (in the same way the archivinfs does) and store the data inside there.

A moving_filesystem_data_store can be setup via "smt init (/configure) --move (/-MO) /target/path/
